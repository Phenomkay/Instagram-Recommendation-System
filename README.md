# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing Instagram data to gain insights into user engagement patterns. The analysis includes examining the impact of different days of the week and hashtags on engagement metrics such as impressions, likes, comments, and shares. The project also includes functions to recommend the best hashtags and days to post based on historical data.

## Importing Libraries

To begin this project, we needed to have imported the following python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Description

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Aman Kharwal's GitHub repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/Instagram%20data.csv). It contains various metrics related to Instagram posts, including:

- **Date**: The date the post was made.
- **Impressions**: Total number of impressions the post received.
- **From Home**: Impressions from the home feed.
- **From Hashtags**: Impressions coming from hashtags.
- **From Explore**: Impressions from the explore page.
- **From Other**: Other sources of impressions.
- **Saves**: Number of times the post was saved.
- **Comments**: Number of comments on the post.
- **Shares**: Number of times the post was shared.
- **Likes**: Number of likes the post received.
- **Profile Visits**: Number of visits to the profile from the post.
- **Follows**: Number of follows generated by the post.
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of profile visits that resulted in follows.
- **Caption**: The text caption accompanying the post.
- **Hashtags**: Hashtags used in the post.

## Data Preprocessing

1. **Loading Data**: The data was loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Conversion**: The `Date` column was converted to datetime format.
3. **Feature Extraction**: The day of the week was extracted from the `Date` column, and hashtags were split into a list for further analysis.

## Analysis

### Day of the Week Analysis

The average impressions, likes, comments, and shares were calculated for each day of the week to identify the best days for posting.

### Insights:
- **Tuesday** has the highest average impressions, suggesting that posts made on this day tend to reach more people.
- **Friday** has the lowest average impressions, indicating that posts on this day might not perform as well in terms of reach.
- Other days like **Monday** and **Wednesday** also show relatively high average impressions, while **Saturday** and **Sunday** are in the middle range.

This graph can help in understanding the best days to post content to maximize reach and engagement on Instagram.

### Hashtag Analysis

The average impressions, likes, comments, and shares were calculated for each hashtag to identify the most effective hashtags.

### Insights:
- Each hashtag has two bars: one for **Impressions** (in blue) and one for **Likes** (in orange).
- **#pythonprogrammer** has the highest average impressions, followed closely by **#pythonprogramminglanguage**.
- **#python3** and **#pythoncoding** also show significant engagement but are slightly lower than the top two.
- **#pythondeveloper** has the lowest average impressions and likes among the five hashtags.
- Across all hashtags, impressions are consistently higher than likes, indicating that while many users see the posts, a smaller proportion engage by liking them.

This graph helps identify which hashtags are most effective in reaching a larger audience and generating likes

### Correlation Analysis

A correlation heatmap was generated to understand the relationships between different engagement metrics.

### Insights:
- **Diagonal Line**: The diagonal from the top left to the bottom right shows perfect correlations (value of 1) as it represents each metric's correlation with itself.
- **High Correlations**:
  - **Impressions and Likes**: High positive correlation, suggesting that posts with more impressions tend to receive more likes.
  - **Likes and Comments**: Also show a strong positive correlation, indicating that posts with more likes often receive more comments.
  - **Shares and Saves**: These metrics are highly correlated, meaning posts that are shared frequently are also often saved.
- **Moderate Correlations**:
  - **Impressions and Follows**: Moderate positive correlation, suggesting that posts with higher impressions can lead to an increase in followers.
  - **Comments and Shares**: Moderate correlation, indicating that posts with more comments are likely to be shared more.

This heatmap helps in understanding how different engagement metrics are related to each other.

### Distribution Analysis

The distribution of likes, comments, and shares was plotted to understand the spread and central tendency of these metrics.

![Engagement distribution]([https://github.com/Kay/my-repo/blob/main/images/my_image.png?raw=true](https://github.com/Phenomkay/Instagram-Recommendation-System/blob/79f6a681cc95d0bad0f1619408f9a7d5331ac307/engagement%20distribution.png))

### Insights:
- **Likes (Blue Bars)**: The frequency of likes is highest at the lower end of the engagement metrics, indicating that most posts receive a lower number of likes.
- **Comments (Orange Bars)**: Similar to likes, comments are also more frequent at the lower end, suggesting that posts generally receive fewer comments.
- **Shares (Green Bars)**: Shares follow the same pattern, with the majority of posts being shared less frequently.

Overall, this graph indicates that lower engagement numbers (likes, comments, and shares) are more common, while higher engagement numbers are less frequent. This distribution can help in understanding the typical engagement levels for Instagram posts and setting realistic expectations for post performance.
